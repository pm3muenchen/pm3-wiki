# How to View PM3 Shared Calendar

## Group calendar invitations include links to calendars
Members receive email notifications with links to the shared calendar.

- ***Individual users and existing group members*** - Users get email notifications when calendars are shared.
- ***New group members*** - New group members get email notifications about the calendars they can access, typically within an hour after joining the group. New group members do not get this notification email if the group has more than 100 calendars shared to it.

These email notifications include an Add to calendar link. If a user clicks this link and then ***Add calendar***, the calendar shows up in the Other calendars list for that user.

## Help people find shared calendars

To help people find shared calendars, you can send them the calendar ID.

1. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/).
2. Under My calendars, find the shared calendar.
3. Point to the shared calendar and click More and then ***Settings and sharing***.
4. Scroll down to the Integrate calendar section and copy the Calendar ID. It's long. 
5. Paste this ID into a document or website that you give to new users.
6. Tell them to take the following actions:
    - Next to Other calendars, click "plus" and then ***Subscribe to calendar***.
    - Paste the Calendar ID into the Add a calendar box and press ***Enter***.

The calendar then shows up in the userâ€™s Other calendars list.
